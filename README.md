qFilter has been developed by Michele Schimd (skimmoz@gmail.com) as part of a
Ph.D. thesis, as that it may not use best options and best algorithms and it
may be not as easy to use as many other public software. However, in the hope
if it being useful to somebody, it is still publicly available to download
